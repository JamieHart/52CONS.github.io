##Changelog

Apparently multiple passages were duplicated, this issue has been resolved.

Redid references list to add references left out in previous versions.

Total keywords list revamp, expanding existing lists references significantly and new lists for added references.

Customized several references with expandable sub-references to mitigate text wall.

Made the user input bar more dynamic, allowing the estimated dollar box to still be clickable on phone screens instead of scrunching up. Additionally, the items will stack more pleasantly on smaller screens.

Combined the clickable examples that set the user input box to whatever option was clicked with the word "example" that you could also click to cycle through a list of examples not written out, now in shiny button form.

Changed font size, I think I changed the font too. Don't quote me on that.

Added more links from references.

Rewrote search function to accommodate revamped lists and references.

Added quick help buttons on a left side bar.

Added additional visual cursor functionality.

Changed the "!" button to "MPT" and the content changed from prohibited uses to the micro purchase thresholds (MPT), the prohibited uses have been moved to the left sidebar.
